01. Yo have seen ls, cd & pwd but there's more...
02. Many of them can support options or parameters to turn on other behaviours!
	i.e. ls -l or ls -l Downloads/  (print out a more detailed command)
03. the -l is for long
04. if you want to list all the corresponding files you use an asterisk(*)
	i.e. ls -l Documents/*.pdf {if it matchs the pattern it gets printed)
