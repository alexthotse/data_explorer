01. The shell prompt: usually display the information about the computer you're logged into
echo command = make the shell print the message back to us
i.e. echo Hello, shello! ==> Hello, shello!
{similar to console.log in JS or print in Python}
02. But echo Hello, shello!! prints something different!!!
03. Because there are some characters that have a special meaning in Bash Shell
04. To avoid this add  "..." to  the command
