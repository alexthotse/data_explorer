01. Moving files in the GUI would require alot of Drag & Drop
02. But in the CLI you can complete alot with a few commands
03. mkdir = make directory {.i.e. mkdir Documents/Books}
04. mv = move {i.e. mv 'Documents/Memorize Everything.epub' Documents/Books/}
 {.i.e. mv 'FROM=old destination' TO=new destination} 
05. But if you are smart you can select all files with an astericks!!!!
	{i.e. mv Documents/*.epub Documents/Books} Moves all epub's to Books folder
