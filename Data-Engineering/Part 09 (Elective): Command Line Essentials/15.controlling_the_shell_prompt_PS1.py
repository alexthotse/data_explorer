($PS1)
01. When you start up a terminal, what do you see??
	usually you see a shell prompt
02. But what it says will differ from system to system like the one that comes with git bash for windows.
03. flexo:~student$: 1.first it will show the computer I'm using 
			2. ~ the home directory abbriviated tilda
			3. and the name of the user I'm logged in as {student}
04. {man bash==>dope command} This here is from the bash manual
05. Which doesn't get installed with git bash for windows unfortunately (not really) can look it up online
06. In order to use any of these or many other codes you need to put it in the PS1 shell variable.
07. But where would you do that?
08. In the .bash_profile usually or .bashrc on linux or if you did that trick to get it to run there as well {adding date and echo to the Shell}   
09. you can add/cusromize your shell however you like.
10. Alot of developers have a display in information about the current state of the project they're working on
11. Check out bashrcgenerator.com
12. Sometimes I don't want to distract you I set PS1='$ ' ==> $ ls {nopath shown} keeping it simple.
